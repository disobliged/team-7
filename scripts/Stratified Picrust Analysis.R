# This script calculates how much each taxon contributes to each pathway.
# The idea is to figure out if there are any taxa that contribute a large 
#   proportion of the reads to a given pathway, which would suggest that they 
#   are the main drivers of that pathway in the community.
# If there are no clear high-contributing taxa, that would suggest that the 
#   pathway is more evenly distributed across the community, and there are no 
#   clear 'drivers' of that pathway.
