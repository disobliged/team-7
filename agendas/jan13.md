##  Project Ideas
### IBD Ryan
- Do sex differences in the gut microbiome modify responses to treatment to various drugs for Crohn’s disease?
- How lifestyle affects different parts of the colon?

### MS
- Does breastfeeding reduce incidents of MS?
- Do allergies have an impact on MS?

### Fish
- Does the species of fish and microbial diversity affect swimming performance and what depth they reside?
- Does the depth and distance of shore affect microbial diversity of the fish?

### Anemia during Infancy
a. Does solid/liquid diet affect TCA cycle metabolites in anemic infants?
b. Alpha diversity in anemic infants?

### Vaping and Smoking 
- Forms of tobacco use (e-cigarettes, chewing tobacco, second-hand smoke exposure) on the gut microbiome?

### Gut microbiome associated with diet Westernization 
- Does fiber intake affect cardiometabolic status?
- Nutrient composition (cholesterol, fats) correlated to age?

### IBD halfvarson
- How do calprotein levels and microbiome composition change with respect to cd location?
- Do certain geographic or demographic factors correlate with distinct cd behaviour?

### Texas Diabetes
- How do specific hip, waist and arm circumference measurements correlate with blood sugar and different lipid types (i.e. cholesterol) compared to BMI alone? Would one be a better predictor for diabetes risk?

### Parkinsons
- Are there caloric and nutritional intake trends that characterize Parkinson's disease and is there a correlation with insomnia/sleep issues?
