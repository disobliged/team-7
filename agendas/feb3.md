# Team 7 Meeting #4, February 3rd, 2026
Research Question:
> Do fish species and their associated microbial diversity in hindgut samples influence swimming performance and preferred depth in water? 

##  Fish Dataset and Group Assignment 2 - Minutes by Izaak Yip

### Develop 'Aims'
- Focused questions to answer specific parts of the main research question

#### Aims
1. Alpha & beta diversity correlation between microbiome & performance
2. Core microbiome analysis, Different locations have different microbiota
3. Functional analysis - picrust2
-  M1: see pathways are upregulated, check pathways to see if they produce more energy - MetaCyc or Kegg
-  M2: going in blind or literature search first
4. DEseq (differential abundance) - inform the relations to picrust (If one taxa is upregulated or not)
- Comparison of singular groups between different water levels - subgroup data - trophic levels (predators vs prey fish), breakdown

### Running Analyses
- Which analyses would be the most appropriate to run on this dataset, given the read quality and sample size (from Group Assignment 1)

Two Options
1. Find and know the pathways we need to analyze.
- Metasiq or keg and see what patterns exist for metabolites
- Conduct a literature search
2. Blind do analysis and see patterns emerge

- Make a comparison table of different variables

### Background for Fish
- Given that this is a paper meant for other scholars, how much background information is expected for this manuscript?
- Discuss fish taxa?
- Importance of fish in our ecosystem?
