# Team 7 Meeting #3, January 27th, 2026
We have narrowed down our research project to the fish dataset, with our research question as: 
> Do the species of fish and microbial diversity affect swimming performance, and at what depth do they reside?

##  Fish Dataset and Group Assignment 1 

### Fish
> Do the species of fish and microbial diversity affect swimming performance, and at what depth do they reside?
- 5 groups of different fish performances, 30+ different fish, can be a viable, novel research topic from the literature review, papers showing biological and environmental differences for fish or microbial diversity for the fitness of fish.

**Comments**\
The research papers cited in creating the research questions can be found here.
- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39466622/
- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40564368/

We plan to:
- Separate slow vs. fast fish into groups
- Both viable questions
- Can't do just depth for analysis, would have to connect with swimming performance
- Key terms for fast and slow fish 

**Workflow**
1. Determine the groups
2. Compare broadly slow vs. fast groups (alpha and beta diversity) - 2 group comparison
3. Differential abundance
4. Functional analysis
5. Pathway analysis
6. Core microbiome
7. Do other analyses not included in the course

Issue with making it complicated enough

- This is the ```demux.qzv``` file.
- Issue with PHRED Quality Score when demultiplexing the fish dataset, having trouble choosing a truncation length.
- Do we preserve read length, or high-quality reads?
