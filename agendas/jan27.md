# Team 7 Meeting #3, January 27th, 2026
We have narrowed down our research project to the fish dataset, with our research question as: 
- Does the species of fish and microbial diversity affect swimming performance and what depth they reside?

##  Fish Dataset and Group Assignment 1 

### Fish
- Does the species of fish and microbial diversity affect swimming performance and what depth they reside?
- 5 groups of different fish performances, 30+ different fish, can be a viable, novel research topic from literature review, papers showing biological and environmental differences for fish or microbial diversity for fitness of fish.

**Comments**\
The research papers cited in creating the research questions can be found here.
- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39466622/
- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40564368/
- Seperate slow vs. fast fish into groups
- Both viable questions
- Can't do just depth for analysis, would have to connect with swimming performance
- Key terms for fast and slow fish 

**Workflow**
- Determine the groups
- Compare broadly slow vs. fast groups (alpha and beta diversity) - 2 group comparison
- Differential abundance
- Functional analysis
- Pathway analysis
- Core microbiome
- Do other analyses not included in the course
- Issue with making it complicated enough

- Issue with PHRED Quality Score when demultiplexing the fish dataset, having trouble choosing a truncation length
