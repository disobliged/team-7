# Team 7 Meeting #2, January 20th, 2026
We have curated research questions based on the discussions we had last team meeting. We have narrowed our potential projects down to three datasets and 6 potential research questions.

##  Datasets and Research Questions - Finalizing a Topic

### IBD Ryan
- Do sex differences in the gut microbiome modify responses to treatment to various drugs for Crohn’s disease?
- 6 drugs with enough samples and it could also be interesting to compare the treatment combinations (with and without anti-TNF)

**Comments**\
Not much literature specifically investigating sex differences in the gut microbiome and how these differences change in response to treatment. Not specifically in terms of medications/drugs. 

### Fish
- Does the species of fish and microbial diversity affect swimming performance and what depth they reside?
- 5 groups of different fish performances, 30+ different fish, can be a viable, novel research topic from literature review, papers showing biological and environmental differences for fish or microbial diversity for fitness of fish.

**Comments**\
The research papers cited in creating the research questions can be found here.

### Anemia during Infancy
- Does solid/liquid diet affect TCA cycle metabolites in anemic infants?
- Alpha diversity in anemic infants?

**Comments**\
We could use datasets from the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Multinomics Database (https://ibdmdb.org/results) and remove everything except the controls then use it to find bacteria that correlate to the TCA metabolites. The main downside would be that the data is from stool, not serum, but otherwise it's good quality.
