# Team 7 Meeting #1, January 13th, 2025

##  Summary - Annabel Lu
### IBD Ryan
- Do sex differences in the gut microbiome modify responses to treatment to various drugs for Crohn’s disease?
- *Categorize drugs by function/use and check that drug data has enough samples per group 
- How lifestyle affects different parts of the colon? (might be hard)

### MS
- Does breastfeeding reduce incidents of MS? (maybe)
- Do allergies have an impact on MS? (maybe)
- ie. Could compare MS trends of patients with and without allergies 

### Fish
- Does the species of fish and microbial diversity affect swimming performance and what depth they reside? *Check for enough fish samples per group (manually count, fish double sampled)
- Does the depth and distance of shore affect microbial diversity of the fish? (already done)

### Anemia during Infancy
- Does solid/liquid diet affect TCA cycle metabolites in anemic infants?
- Alpha diversity in anemic infants?
- Look for external dataset with metabolite levels, infant/kids + 16S data

### Vaping and Smoking 
- Forms of tobacco use (e-cigarettes, chewing tobacco, second-hand smoke exposure) on the gut microbiome?(rejected)

### Gut microbiome associated with diet Westernization 
- Does fiber intake affect cardiometabolic status? (rejected)
- Nutrient composition (cholesterol, fats) correlated to age? (rejected)

### IBD halfvarson
- How do calprotein levels and microbiome composition change with respect to cd location? (rejected)
- Do certain geographic or demographic factors correlate with distinct cd behaviour? (rejected)

### Texas Diabetes
- How do specific hip, waist and arm circumference measurements correlate with blood sugar and different lipid types (i.e. cholesterol) compared to BMI alone? Would one be a better predictor for diabetes risk? (rejected)

### Parkinsons
- Are there caloric and nutritional intake trends that characterize Parkinson's disease and is there a correlation with insomnia/sleep issues? (rejected)

### To-Do
- All members to go through literature for top 3 questions and test out categorizing data 
- Finalize dataset + draft research question next week 
- Weekly send a GitHub link/post meeting agenda by Monday evenings 
- Have someone to take meeting notes each week (rotate)
