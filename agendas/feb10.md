## Literature Search 

MetaCyc vs KEGG
- Most studies seem to use KEGG rather than MetaCyc
- In the context of our research question, MetaCyc might be more suitable because it provides detailed information on individual enzyme reactions and steps of specific metabolic pathways (rather than the more general trends that KEGG would provide)
- The pathways in KEGG are standardized and we could still determine which ones affect swimming performance and preferred depth in water but we would not have a layered understanding of the specific steps/enzymes in the metabolic processes which drive these outcomes

## Functional Analysis Approach
1. Find and know the pathways we need to analyze
   - Pros: Perhaps easier to interpret and understand patterns because they already established in the literature, may strenghten existing findings
   - Cons: A more bias approach which limits the exploration of new patterns 
  
2. Going in blind (without literature guidance)
   - Pros: Might find new and novel patterns, allowing trends to emerge naturally without inherent bias from previous literature, minimizes bias
   - Cons: Might find biologically irrelevant patterns, trends might be harder to interpret without context


## Group 2 Assignment - Analyses

Fill in analysis table:

For each technique, decide:
- a) Which ones you currently plan to use (highlight, change colour, etc)
- b) Whether each chosen technique typically uses statistics*
- c) Which aim each chosen technique will contribute to
- d) How each chosen technique will help you address your research question biologically
