# Team 7 Meeting #6, February 24th, 2026
Research Question:
> Do fish species and their associated microbial diversity in hindgut samples influence swimming performance and preferred depth in water?

## Proposal Draft 

- Brainstorm ideas for the Proposal, distribute roles and scaffold a timeline

## Confirm Aims
- We have 4 aims drafted:
  
- Aim 1: Determining whether hindgut microbiome alpha and beta diversity differ with swimming performance and preferred depth in water, and whether these metrics correlate with fish traits.
- Aim 2: Identify differences in core hindgut microbiota and differentially abundant taxa across fish of different swimming performance and water depth preference.
- Aim 3: Determine whether PICRUSt2-predicted energy metabolism pathways are enriched in fish in fast swimmers and distinct water depth preferences.
- Aim 4: Assess whether PICRUSt2-predicted energy metabolism pathways correlate with the taxa identified as differentially abundant.

### Questions

- Are the aims appropriately scoped, sufficiently cover all aspects of the research question, are we missing anything?

## Filtering 

- Figure out how to group the data

### Questions

- For each aim, which parts of the data should we use, how should we group them?

## Confirm analyses

- Aim 1: Alpha/Beta diversity, Spearman correlation 
- Aim 2: Taxonomy bar plot, core microbiome, differential abundance
- Aim 3: PICRUSt2/ggpicrust
- Aim 4: Spearman correlation

### Questions

- Are these analyses appropriate?

## Proposal Writing 

- Scaffold the proposal timeline
- Assign roles (ex. Intro & Background, Hypothesis or Prediction, Experimental Aims and Rationale, Proposed Approach, Workflow Overview/Timeline, Participation Report, References)

## Overview of Graphs by Aims 
#### Aim 1 
- Alpha plots for each swim performance category (5)
- Alpha plots for each depth category (divide depth by literature or quartiles/tertiles)
- Beta diversity plot

#### Aim 2
- Core microbiome analysis as venn diagram 
- Visualize AncomBC
- Comparisons to make: either faster or slower vs. generalists
- Volcano plot

##### Aim3 
- Same as 2 but filtered for high energy metabolites
- Fast vs everything else, looking specifically at pathways with energy relevance 
- *ID the paths of interest on the volcano plot 

#### Aim 4
- Spearman rank graph

### Questions 

- Intro/Background: How much detail on fish physiology, swim performance and depth behaviour do we need to include?
- What else should we include?
- Should we justify the use of hindgut samples?

### Comments on Aims 
- Aim 1: addresses a lot of variables, clarify the wording and/or split this aim into separate questions
- Wording to clarify: "fish traits", "correlate continuous"
- Aim 3: good phrasing, good specificity for energy metabolism 
- Change DESeq2 to AncomBC: we are using AncomBC for this course
- Spearman test: works for depth (continuous variable) but not swimming speeds (categorical) 



### Additional Meeting Notes
- It may be helpful to mention in the discussion that this database is biased for specific fish species 
- For background and justifiction: can reference other papers looking at microbiota & performance in animals
- Hindgut selection justification: hindgut is the most likely location to find energy metabolites
