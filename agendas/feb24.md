# Team 7 Meeting #6, February 24th, 2026
Research Question:
> Do fish species and their associated microbial diversity in hindgut samples influence swimming performance and preferred depth in water?

## Proposal Draft 

- Brainstorm ideas for the Proposal, distribute roles and scaffold a timeline

## Confirm Aims
- We have 4 aims drafted:
  
- Aim 1: Determining whether hindgut microbiome alpha and beta diversity differ with swimming performance and preferred depth in water, and whether these metrics correlate with fish traits.
- Aim 2: Identify differences in core hindgut microbiota and differentially abundant taxa across fish of different swimming performance and water depth preference.
- Aim 3: Determine whether PICRUSt2-predicted energy metabolism pathways are enriched in fish in fast swimmers and distinct water depth preferences.
- Aim 4: Assess whether PICRUSt2-predicted energy metabolism pathways correlate with the taxa identified as differentially abundant.

### Questions

- Are the aims appropriately scoped, sufficiently cover all aspects of the research question, are we missing anything?

## Filtering 

- Figure out how to group the data

### Questions

- For each aim, which parts of the data should we use, how should we group them?

## Confirm analyses

- Aim 1: Alpha/Beta diversity, Spearman correlation 
- Aim 2: Taxonomy bar plot, core microbiome, differential abundance
- Aim 3: PICRUSt2/ggpicrust
- Aim 4: Spearman correlation

### Questions

- Are these analyses appropriate?

## Proposal Writing 

- Scaffold the proposal timeline

### Questions 

- Intro/Background: How much detail on fish physiology, swim performance and depth behaviour do we need to include?
- What else should we include?
- Should we justify the use of hindgut samples?
